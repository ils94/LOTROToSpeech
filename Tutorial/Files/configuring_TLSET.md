# Configuring LOTRO to Speech - Edge-TTS Version

Open your game and look for a NPC with a quest available so you can use it as base:

**Tip:** Increase the font size of the quest window, to increase the accurecy of the OCR detection.

Now open LOTRO To Speech overlay and hold Ctrl + Left Mouse Button to drag a rectangle around the text of the quest:

**Tip:** Try to adjust the rectangle edges a bit close to the text, but not so close. That way, the OCR has less area to scan.

While in the LOTRO To Speech overlay, you can use the **OCR Result** window by pressing **Ctrl + A** to quickly preview the OCR Result and see if the text is being captured. The **Menu - Refresh OCR** can be used to quickly refresh the OCR data and show how is the text beind capture in real time.

**Tip:** Resize the Quest Window as much as you can, and leave the it away from your Chat, because if you leave it close, the OCR may read your chat window. Also, increase the font size of the Quest Window, but do not increase it too much, else, the text will become too big and will add Scrollbars. The text must be 100% visible in the screen for the OCR to detect it.

After you are done setting everything, you can minimize it (do not close LOTRO To Speech) and press "Ctrl + Alt" to enable the TTS.

Now, you are ready for the next step:
