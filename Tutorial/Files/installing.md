# Installing

First, you will need to install Tesseract, which is a program that performs OCR to convert image to text.

You can download Tesseract from this [link](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)

There is a very nice tutorial teaching how to install Tesseract on Windows by [linuxhint](https://linuxhint.com/install-tesseract-windows/)

Download and install getNPCNames Plugin. This Plugin is VERY NECESSARY to dynamically choose the proper voice model for the NPCs based on their gender.

Link: [Thanking again dt192 for this plugin!](https://github.com/ils94/LOTROToSpeech/raw/master/Helpful%20Stuffs/Plugins/Dt192.zip)

If you don't know how to install a Plugin, you can follow the tutorial in this [link](https://www.lotrointerface.com/wiki/Install_plugins)

After installing Tesseract, download LTSET (LOTRO To Speech - Edge-TTS Version) or LTSEL (LOTRO To Speech - Elevenlabs TTS Version)

[LTSET Download Link](https://github.com/ils94/LOTROToSpeech/releases/download/LTSET-Release/LTSET.zip) (up to date)

[LTSEL Download Link](https://github.com/ils94/LOTROToSpeech/releases/download/LTSEL-Release/LTSEL.zip) (up to date)

unzip the version you downloaded, and run either LTSET.exe or LTSEL.exe inside the program root folder.

Now, you are ready for the next step:
