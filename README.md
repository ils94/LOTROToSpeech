# LOTRO To Speech
Python program that uses Tesseract to do OCR to get text on your screen and convert to string, then, using Windows built in EN-US TTS to voice over the quest text.

# Installing

First, you will need to install Tesseract which is a program that converts image to string.

You can download Tesseract from this link:

https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki

After installing, you can run the program.

# How to use

When you first run the program, a transparent window will pop up. In that window, you can use your mouse to drag a rectangle. With the game open and a Quest Window also open, open maximize the transparent window so you can have an idea where you should draw the rectangle. Tip: Make the Quest Window big, so the program can OCR the whole text easier.
